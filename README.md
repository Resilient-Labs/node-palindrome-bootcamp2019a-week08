## How It's Made:

I created an Automatic palindrom checker that calls back to the server once you stop typing to check if your input is a Palindrome. No submit button or Enter key needed. Although if 750 milliseconds is too slow for your quick hands, I've enabled the enter button to send your data to be checked too :)

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js
